FizzBuzz

Solve the FizzBuzz problem

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

Why?

Using FizzBuzz problem solving for learning Test Driven Development(TDD) more like taking the first step into TDD. By using FizzBuzz and implementing it in TDD will try to get a more indepth and working knowledge of unit testing and development based on test cases.

Approach:

By using the basic concepts of TDD, breaking down the problem statement into the basic use cases and thus forming the test cases based on which the development is done, after every test case is passed then trying to refactor wherever applicaple the devlopment of this project is done.
